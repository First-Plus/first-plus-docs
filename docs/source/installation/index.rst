Download the file corresponding to your operating system, and then open the file and follow the installation prompts that pop up.

Mu gives you the option to run different implementations of Python for different microcontrollers. In our case, we want to run CircuitPython, which is compatible with our Maker Pi RP2040. Select the "Mode" button shown below.
